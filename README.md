## Introduction

The repository ADM-HW5-Group26 contains the code from Homework 5 for the course of Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining (Master of Data Science 22/23 University of La Sapienza). 

The goal of the homework is to improve the familiarity with the creation, manipulation and visualization of graphs using the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) library of Python.

## Files Contained

* The file `main.ipynb` contains a Jupyter Notebook with tasks 1-3 and the Algorithmic Question. In particular, here you can find the "controller_system" function where choosing a functionality and some parameters as inputs you can view the results of the functionality on the graphs. 
* The file `CommandLine.sh` contains the answer to Command Line Question in a .sh bash executable file.
* The folder `img` contains the file `CommandLineScreenShot.png`, an image showing the results of the Command Line Question runned.
* The file `measures_centrality.py` contains the functions about functionality2.
* The file `functions.py` contains the functions about functionality1, functionality3 and functionality4.
